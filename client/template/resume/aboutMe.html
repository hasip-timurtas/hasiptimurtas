		I'm a 24 years old developer based in Istanbul, Turkey, I specialise in building web apps. My career started at an early age, when I was 16 I started programming damage calculation software in high school. With the pass of the years, I decided to transform my hobby into a profession so I studied programming in Karabuk University. I consider myself a full-stack developer. I'm currently working in I2I Systems a company which supports billing & charging in the telecommunications sector. My task is supporting and developing Call Center's web interface. But after 2,5 years in the same company I do not enjoy this job, because I think my improvement has stoped here. So I am searching new jobs opportunities. I enjoy developing web applications and learning new technologies for developing faster and better. I am a self-taught person for example, I started to learn MeteorJs in my spare time and made some web applications. I also love learning new things and improving my skills in different web platforms such as Udemy, teamtreehouse and youtube. I like Javascript {Javascript is everywhere : ) }, coffee, linux and playing guitar. I enjoy building stuff, investigating new technologies and general hacking.
